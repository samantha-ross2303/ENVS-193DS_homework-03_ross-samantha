**Description**: This is the repo for homework 3 for ENVS 193DS, Spring 2024.  

**Author**: Samantha Ross  

**Focus**: I visualized average walking and running distance as a function of school day (yes or no). I drafted an affective visualization using my personal data. I conducted a statistical critique of my chosen [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-008-9114-9).
